### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the founder of a boutique IT services company called [eSolia](https://esolia.com), based in Tokyo. We started in 1999, and hope to remain healthy, even through COVID! 

I have spent my career in IT in Japan, doing a wide range of activities, such as compsci tutoring, physical cabling, network engineering, project management, software development, system architecture and design, solution consulting, and delivering training courses to name a few. Sometimes I look back with nostalgia on the way things were in the late 80s, but mostly, I like how things are now!
